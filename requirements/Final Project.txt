Problem Statement

You are to create a project for a census bureau to obtain and analyze household income survey data within the Cincinnati area (including Northern Ky).  

Data Collected: 

•	Date of the survey – required
•	State - required
•	Ohio 
•	Kentucky
•	County - required
•	The following counties will only be used for input:
•	For Ohio
•	Hamilton
•	Butler

•	For Kentucky
•	Boone
•	Kenton
•	Race of head of household – required (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian, Other)
•	Number in Household – required, must be greater than 0
•	The household yearly income – required, must be numeric, must be greater than 0.

Instructions

•	Create an application  (Part 1) that will accept and validate all of the data collected and save it as a comma delimited text file.  All new data must be appended to the old data.
•	Create another application (Part 2) that will read in the most recent text file, load it to a structure array, and process the array based on the action requested. The following letters represent the selections of a potential action from the user.  In other words, a user would enter “A” when prompted and the action from “A” below will be processed and printed (neatly) on the screen. 

A.	Total Households Surveyed: Will show the total of the overall surveyed. 
B.	Total Households Surveyed per County: Will show the total of the overall surveyed by county and state.  (Like example below). 
C.	Total Households Surveyed per Race: Will show the total of the overall surveyed by county and state.  (Like example below). 
D.	Average Household Income: Show the overall average household income for those that are surveyed.
E.	Average Household Income by county and state: Will display the average household income by state and then by county (see below for example).
F.	Average Household Income by race: Will display the average household income by race (see below for example).
G.	Percentage below Poverty: Show the overall percentage of those below poverty based on the table below for all data collected. 
H.	Percentage below Poverty by county and state: Show the overall percentage of those below poverty based on the table below for all data collected by county and state (see below of example). 
I.	Percentage below Poverty by race: Show the overall percentage of those below poverty based on the table below for all data collected by race (see below of example). 

•	Create a well designed modular program based on design techniques taught. 
•	Use good naming conventions on all variables, procedures, functions, etc. 
•	Make sure all functions and procedures are called “down”.
•	All data in the second application must be loaded and processed within a structure array. 
•	20 points extra credit if you can dynamically allocate the exact amount of memory needed for your structure array.   If not, use 100 entries as a static array.  (you would need to know how many records were added in Part 1 that could somehow be passed to Part 2). 
•	AND YOU MUST USE POINTERS CORRECTLY.  LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.  



Example layout of data for the various queries above:

Average Household Income

Ohio:   	$30,000
   Hamilton:  	$40,000
   Butler:  	$20,000
 
Kentucky:	$37,500
   Boone:	$40,000
   Kenton:	$35,000


Basis of Poverty: 

•	Household of 1 and less than $12,000
•	Household of 2 and less than $18,000
•	Household of 3 and less than $25,000
•	Household of 4 and less than $30,000
•	Household of 5 or more and less than $40,000
